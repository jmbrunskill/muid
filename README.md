# muID - An open standard for creating Keyed Decentralised Application Specific Unique IDs

Modern cloud based applications and distributed systems demand a reliable and decentralised mechanism for creating unique IDs.

The many modern applications utilise a standard such as RFC4122 to generate globally unique ids with almost 0% chance of a collision. 
See: (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4122) or (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier)

However in many applications, global uniqueness is not critial, and other concerns such as id length and performance concerns become more important.

This standard documents a mechanism for creating key'd 64bit ids which might be more useful for some application specific purposes than a globally unique id (GUID/UUID).

## Why create this?

As a developer working with UUID's can be frustrating and hard to reason about.
Lets say in your database you have 2 ids `e9bdd14e-a796-11e9-a2a3-2a2ae2dbcce4` and `e9bdd4c8-a796-11e9-a2a3-2a2ae2dbcce4`

If while debugging code you see the id `e9bdd4c8-a796-11e9-a2a3-2a2ae2dbcce4` it's pretty hard to recognise which one of those 2 ids it is.

With muID's in normal circumstances you'll only have to look at the last 4-6 characters to differentiate ids in context. `115570d-057-1ade7` vs `115570d-fb9-1de01`

Additionally this format allows you use a normal BIGINT (64bit) datatype in your database, which may make db queries & joins more efficent.
AND it reduces the length of the id, which can represent as significant bandwidth consumption in some applications.

## When *not* to use this
* If your application is expecting to consistently create 100's or 1000's of ids per second
* If you have a significant number of machines or threads generating ids concurrently
* If you need to use an internationally recognised standard
* If you need an ID that's cryptographicly secure
* If you need a true globally unique id

## When should I use this?
* Your application needs to generate unique ids without central co-ordination but doesn't need to work at google scale (1000's per second)
* You have some kind of internal ids or keys that you can use to minimise the chance of a muid being duplicated by different id generators
* You don't need to generate huge numbers of ids in a short period of time (Libraries may deliberately rate limit id creation to avoid duplication)

You might also want...
* Ids that are more easily recognised by a human
* Shorter ids (eg. send less bits across a network)
* To be able to use BIGINT keys in your SQL Database (for performance or other reasons)

## Alternatives
_Have you heard about twitter snowflake or boundry flake?_
Yes, It's fair to say I was inspired by these types of uuid generators.
However this standard focuses on readability over speed and robustness.

## Why is is called muID?
mu stands for the greek letter 'Î¼' it represents the relative 'smallness'.
You could think of this as microID but it's 64bit so still not tiny!

## Is it in production?
Sort of, this has only been used for batch id generation so far. It's not being used by distributed systems to generate 1000's of ids.

## The Nitty Gritty

The muID format is formed using optional key'd strings these allow the creator of the id to have some control over how an id is created.

SOURCE_KEY - This is intended to represent a datasource, server, site etc - This should be different for different generation sources
This key will be hashed and the lower bits of this hash used to create the 12bit SOURCEID.
Note: If this is not provided library should substitute some kind of host id (MAC Address for example)

ITEM_KEY - This is intended to represent something likely to be unique about item being identified, eg a Name
This key will be hashed and the lower bits of this hash used to create the 12bit ITEMID.
Note: If this is not provided by the caller, a library should substitute some kind of independantly incrementing or random number

The muid generator should keep an incrementing integer in it's internal state for each source id and itemid combination. 
This is known as the 'SEQ'
This allows for a 256 id's to be created in the same second to without generating a duplicated id.
This per key sequence should be seeded with a random byte to minimise the chance of collision across multiple id producer.
If a key collision occurs during a key generation session, This number should be incremented. If wrapping this number would cause a duplicated id, it is recommended the libraries pause operation,or simply re-hash the item_key.
This makes it suitable for batch processing of ids (eg. generating 1000+ of ids per second if they are keyed with a relevent itemid)

The muID binary format is formed like this:
|<UNIXTIMESTAMP>[32bits]-<SOURCEID>[12bits]-<ITEMID>[12bits]<SEQ>[8bits]|

A string representation of the muID should be in hex format with '-' characters separating the fields UNIXTIMESTAMP-SOURCEID-ITEMIDSEQ

Example muID's
* `int(6714026738942017536),str(115570d-0bf-2a902)`
* `int(6714026738942017537), str(115570d-0bf-2a901)`


## Is this format resilient against clock drift?
Not really. We assume that this case is rare, and that the internal seq state will minimise the chance of a clock drift collision.
